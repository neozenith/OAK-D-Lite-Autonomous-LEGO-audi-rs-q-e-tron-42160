# Scripts

 - `install_dependencies.sh` - Adapted from the OAK-D DepthAI kit install_dependencies scripts and stripped out anything that was nto relevant to RPi4
 - `config.txt` - This belongs in `/boot/firmware/config.txt` on the RPi4, this config has the config needed for the HyperPixel4 Touch to work.
